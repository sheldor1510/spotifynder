Onboarding Feature Part 1: 
A user will be able to sign into our dashboard/web app, using their spotify credentials. This feature will also allow a user to select their top artists and tracks. Their top artists and tracks will allow Spotifynder to better match uses with potential matches. This feature will involve utilizing the spotify api to pull important information from a user’s spotify account.  By integrating this functionality, we not only simplify the login process but also leverage the wealth of data available through the Spotify API to enhance user engagement

Onboarding Feature Part 2: 
This feature is a part two of the onboarding process. Users will now be able to add in their personal playlists from spotify. This information will further make it easier for Spotifynder to find the perfect match ups for users, as it takes into account a user’s unique music taste and preferences. The onboarding process will also include multiple unique questions that a user will answer and display on their profile. These questions allow a user to have more versatility in what they want their profile to display and also it will include their own answers, making their profile more individualized.

Discovery Page Feature: 
The discovery page includes multiple filters for a user. One of the filters Spotifynder will include is a filter by college. This makes it really easy for a user to find people from the same college town vicinity as them. By allowing users to filter by college, Spotifynder creates a more personalized experience, increasing the likelihood of users spending more time on the platform and engaging with others. Many college students are in a new environment, often away from their hometowns. The college filter allows users to find and connect with others who share a similar background or current academic environment, fostering community and friendship. Furthermore, the discovery page will include filters that the user can personalize for themselves. If a user really thinks having the same artist preferences as another Spotifynder user is important to them, they can emphasize on their profile that they want their feed to be filtered by similar music artist preference. This feature is really tailored towards our audience because we want to make sure they get the best matches possible based on factors that are vital to their connections. Spotifyner also has a filter by playlists and filter by track implementation.

Matching Feature Part 1: 
The matching feature is what creates the actual matches in Spotifynder. A user can accept or reject people who have recently liked their profile. An acceptance on both sides would result in a user finding a new match, which is great for them! When a user receives a like, they can view the profile of the person who liked them. This includes their profile picture, bio, interests, and college affiliation. Users can easily accept or reject likes with a simple interface, such as a swipe or button. If both users accept each other, they are notified of the match, enabling them to connect further. If one or both users reject the like, they can continue exploring other profiles without losing the opportunity for future connections.

Matching Feature Part 2: In addition to mutual likes, users can actively select profiles that interest them from their feed. Users can scroll through a curated feed of profiles, featuring users who align with their interests and preferences. This feature allows users to take control of their matching experience, selecting individuals they find appealing based on personal criteria. By enabling users to browse through a wider array of profiles, Spotifynder increases the diversity of potential matches, encouraging connections beyond initial likes.

Chat Feature: 
This feature is crucial to the effectiveness of Spotifynder. The ability for users to chat with their matches is what will allow them to create meaningful connections and friendships. After a user gets a match they have the opportunity to engage in conversation with their match. By enabling communication, the chat feature helps users get to know each other better, fostering relationships based on shared interests and experiences.

Profile Feature: 
The profile feature is what is displayed on a user’s feed. A user will be able to see a profile of a different user, which will appear like a card on their feed. This card will include crucial information about a user and will serve as a form of communication and aid engagement on Spotifynder. This design not only provides a snapshot of each user but also facilitates connections and encourages communication. Each profile appears as a visually appealing card that displays the user’s photo, name, and basic information at a glance. The design should be clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to quickly assess potential matches.
